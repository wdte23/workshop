	<h1>Workshop on Digital Twin Engineering</h1>
        <h3>February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023, IIIT Allahabad, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India, co-located with <a href="https://isec23.iiita.ac.in/">ISEC 2023</a></h3>

     <div class="row" style="content: '';display: table;clear: both;">
     <p>
        Environmental uncertainty and hyperconnectivity force techno-socio- economic
        systems to introspect and adapt to succeed and survive. The current practice is
        primarily intuition-driven, which is inconsistent with the need for precision and
        rigor. The concept of digital twins is rapidly emerging as an experimentation aid to
        help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) prepare for possible outlier
        conditions; and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions
        in an evidence-backed manner. However, its effective
        use is limited to physical and cyber-physical systems that are governed by well-
        established laws and operate in environments that are relatively static or that
        evolve slowly. Its effective exploitation is yet to be seen for techno-socioeconomic
        systems, such as business enterprises and social systems.  
	     The system-of-systems nature, inherent uncertainty, inadequate and fragmented data,
        and dynamic operating environments of these systems make the existing
        modelling, analysis and simulation techniques inadequate.
	</p>
	<p>
	 This workshop brings together leading researchers and
        practitioners a wide spectrum of related fields to explore the
        challenges involved in effectively using digital twin technologies for techno-socio-
        economic systems, and to exchange ideas, concepts, approaches that aim to
        address those challenges. Our key focus to address the following central issues:
	</p>
	 <p>
	<ul {padding: 0 !important;}>
	<li> Long-term life cycle management of digital twins in symbiosis with their real systems. </li>
        <li> Improving the state-of-the-art modelling and simulation capabilities for digital twins. </li>
        <li> Modelling of socio-techno-economic characteristics of large business and societal systems that include spatiotemporal uncertainty, dynamism, and emergentism. </li>
        <li>  Design of collaboration platforms for enabling the joint research work related to digital twins. </li>
        </ul>

                <p><b><br>Title: Role of Digital Twin in Decarbonization of our Energy Systems</b></p>
                <p><b>Abstract</b> Decarbonization of our Energy Systems is one of the biggest challenges facing humankind today.  
                    This is a multifaceted problem with many complex challenges spanning technology, geopolitics, economics, development and justice.  
                    Easy access to energy is one of the key ingredients which power economies and lift masses out of poverty.  
                    Hence the needed transition of the global energy systems to a cleaner future necessitates that society have easy access to more and cleaner energy.  
                    Digital has a key role to play to achieve this transition.  This talk will focus on role of Digital in this journey and narrowing down further, 
                    focus on the digital twin technology and its role as we see it in Shell.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract</b> Robust decision are becoming increasingly important as compared with optimal decisions, 
                    for we want decisions that work effectively in the real-world strife with uncertainty. 
                    Uncertainty can be different levels form certainty to deep uncertainty.  
                    Exploratory Modelling and Analysis (EMA) is meant to specifically cope with deep uncertainty. 
                    It uses computational approaches to analyse complex and uncertain issues. 
                    In this talk we will discuss EMA approach, the use of simulations and AI tools, 
                    and python-based workbench for analysis of complex systems.  Apart from a general overview, this talk will also discuss applications.</p>

                </p>
                <p><b><br>Title: Digital Twins? Yes, but how?</b></p>
                <p><b>Abstract</b> The potential of digital twins is without a doubt. Unfortunately, however, 
                    a digital twin is not a one-man show but requires the collaboration of many stakeholders. 
                    This is especially paramount in the event of building digital twins of systems of systems, e.g., 
                    smart buildings or cities. This situation is aggravated by the fact that most stakeholders rely on their own 
                    tools and modeling formalisms eventually yielding a fractured delivery landscape. Based on this observation,
                    we advocate a digital twin repository in the spirit of traditional model repositories for creating and operating 
                    virtual replicas of digital twins throughout the lifecycle of the twinned system. In this talk, 
                    Philipp Zech will present industrial experiences on the different uses of such a model repository to support 
                    the creation and operation of digital twins throughout the lifecycle of the twinned systems.</p>

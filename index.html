	<h1>2<sup>nd</sup> International Workshop on Digital Twin Engineering 2023</h1>
        <h3>February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2023, IIIT Allahabad, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India, co-located with <a href="https://isec23.iiita.ac.in/">ISEC 2023</a></h3>
        <hr />
        <p>As of the growing interest in gestating digital twins for planning and operating long-living, complex cyber-physical assets, information systems research is now faced with new challenges to develop applicable and profitable methodologies and frameworks for engineering and maintaining these virtual replicas of cyber-physical assets for various industrial domains (automotive, construction, systems engineering or facility management). However, the application of digital twins is not restricted to engineering and related domains. Digital twins also bear the capacity of exploring and defining right interventions for large businesses and societal systems to achieve their operational, economical and sustainability related goals (e.g., Gemini principles) over time. The crux in gestating a digital twin however lies in its inherent complexity which hence already demands for sophisticated engineering by itself. A potential remedy lies in strong collaboration with industrial and economic stakeholders for devising tangible application scenarios to drive the actual gestation of digital twins by providing a basis for practical requirements elicitation. Only this way can future attempts towards gestating digital twins avoid falling victim to the curse of complexity as COTS approaches frankly cannot do the job. However, we also believe that current research has reached a state that provides the relevant enabling technologies for gestating digital twins. To thoroughly examine current needs and demands from industry and economy in correlation with current opportunities from academia and research towards this long-term vision, we thus propose this novel interdisciplinary workshop targeting both academics from information systems research and related fields, and practitioners from industry and economics. In doing so, we aim at addressing the following central issues with our workshop:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Design of collaboration platforms for enabling the joint engineering and maintenance of virtual replicas of complex systems.</li>
            <li>Integration of system modelling, AI, and simulation as central building blocks for digital twins.</li>
            <li>Long-term maintenance and life cycle management of digital twins in symbiosis with their real systems.</li>
            <li>Modelling of socio-techno-economic characteristics of large business and societal systems that include spatiotemporal uncertainty, dynamism, and emergentism.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
